Emulated inputs and outputs

The CPU allows users to configure emulated inputs through the keyboard and allows for one emulated output screen.

The screen is a 32 x 32 memory-mapped chromatic screen located beginning at address $2400. The available colors are:
    - $00: Black
    - $01: White
    - $02: Red
    - $03: Cyan
    - $04: Purple
    - $05: Green
    - $06: Blue
    - $07: Yellow
    - $08: Orange
    - $09: Brown
    - $0A: Pink
    - $0B: Dark gray
    - $0C: Gray
    - $0D: Light green
    - $0E: Light blue
    - $0F: Light gray
Only the low nibble matters; the high nibble will be ignored. As such, $76 will be rendered as blue, as will $06.

Inputs can be mapped to a specific keyboard character or to the keyboard as a whole. If the latter is chosen, any
individual key bindings set will be ignored. When a key with a binding is pressed, its ASCII value will be written to the
appropriate memory location. Note that all values will be assumed to be capitals. Values are obtained through the keyEvent
getCode function, which will provide codes for keys such as the arrow keys and control keys as well.

Key codes for action keys are:
    TAB: $09
    ENTER: $0A
    LSHIFT, RSHIFT: $10
    CONTROL: $11
    ALT: $12
    PAGE_UP: $21
    PAGE_DOWN: $22
    LEFT: $25
    UP: $26
    RIGHT: $27
    DOWN: $28
    ALT_GRAPH: $7E

Inputs may trigger interrupts; if they are set up to do so, an IRQ signal will be sent to the CPU if the I flag is clear.
