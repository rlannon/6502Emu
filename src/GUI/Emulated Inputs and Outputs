Emulated inputs and outputs

The CPU allows users to configure emulated inputs through the keyboard and allows for one emulated output screen.

The screen is a 32 x 32 memory-mapped chromatic screen located beginning at address $2400. The available colors are:
    - $00: Black
    - $01: White
    - $02: Red
    - $03: Cyan
    - $04: Purple
    - $05: Green
    - $06: Blue
    - $07: Yellow
    - $08: Orange
    - $09: Brown
    - $0A: Pink
    - $0B: Dark gray
    - $0C: Gray
    - $0D: Light green
    - $0E: Light blue
    - $0F: Light gray
All other values will be rendered as black.

Inputs can be mapped to a specific keyboard character or to the keyboard as a whole. If the latter is chosen, any
individual key bindings set will be ignored.
Inputs may trigger an IRQ
