.emu Format Description

The .emu file format is used by the emulator to save and retrieve data about programs and emulator configurations.
It is formatted as follows (using stickshift syntax):

prg_header:
    0x00 - (4) magic_number = 0xC0, 'E', 'M', 'U'  ->  Used to identify the file format
    0x04 - (2) version ->  the file version
    0x06 - (1) num_banks   ->  The number of banks of program data
    0x07 - (2) num_debug_symbols   ->  The number of debug symbols present
    0x09 - (1) config  ->  Whether config data is present (1) or not (0).
    0x0a - (6) reserved = 0x00 ->  reserved for future use

for each as indicated by prg_header.num_banks:
    (2) org ->  The origin address for the bank
    (2) len ->  The length (in bytes) of the bank data
    (len)   ->  The bank data

for each as indicated by prg_header.num_debug_symbols:
    (4) label_length    ->  The length of the label string
    (label_length)  ->  The label data
    (4) ->  Line number
    (2) ->  The address of the line

if prg_header.config:
    (2) num_configs ->  The number of configurations present
    for each as indicated by num_configs:
        (2) address (big-endian)    ->  The mapped address
        (1) IRQ ->  boolean value; 0 = false, 1 = true
        (1) key_code_len    ->  the length of the key code string
        (key_code_len) key_code: char[] ->  the actual key code
